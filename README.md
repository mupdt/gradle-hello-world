# IntelliJ Learning Session

We'll be working with IntelliJ's default shortcuts.

Case for using defaults: it makes collaboration easier (e.g.: for pair programming and knowledge sharing).

## Getting started

1. Clone this project.

1. Navigate into the cloned directory and verify that the project builds and runs:

    ```bash
    gradle run
    ```
    
    Expected output:
   
    ```
    > Task :run
    Hello world!
    
    
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
    2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
    ```

1. Open IntelliJ and click `File -> Open...`.

1. Find this project and open it.

1. Open the file `Main.java` and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10`.

1. The application should build and run.
